# Automatic-Diagnosis-of-Cardiac-Pathologies-CMRI-
Implementation of Automatic Diagnosis of Cardiac Pathologies using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI). 

Cardiac pathologies can lead to life-threatening complications, such as heart failure and sudden cardiac arrest. Early detection of 
these pathologies is essential for effective treatment and prevention of complications.

To address this challenge, we used a **dataset** of 150 subjects and extracted features to classify **MRI 
images** into one of five diagnostic classes, including healthy controls and four cardiac pathologies. 

The **dataset** was split into a training-validation set and then the algorithm is used with the given test set. 

I tried three algorithms to classify the subjects: **Random Forest, Linear SVM** and **Non-Linear SVM**. 

I also tried to do some preprocessing such as **PCA** and I tried to segment the images that presented some 
issues.
